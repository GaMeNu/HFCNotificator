# What is This?
This is a bot that connects to the Home Front Command's (Pikud Ha'Oref) servers and sends real-time notifications about
alerts in Israel. Whether you want to receive alerts while playing or chatting with friends on Discord (instead of
touching grass... oh right we're stuck in a shelter), 
or track alerts throughout the country.

The bot's development began in 2023, at the start of the Simchat Torah (Iron Swords) War, and is developed by GaMeNu and
yrrad8.
The bot aims to be relatively fast, reliable, and available for easy hosting, development, and forking.

Feel free to send suggestions and bug reports through our [discord server](https://discord.gg/K3E4a5ekNy), or just fork the bot and add what you want yourself!

A [public instance](https://discord.com/users/1160344131067977738) of the bot is available, but it may be slow or experience downtimes. It is best to host your own instance, if possible!

## Features
- üö® **Real-Time Notifications** - A.K.A. What the bot was designed to do
  - **Server** - The bot can send notifications in registered channels in your Discord server
  - **Direct Messages** - The bot is also capable of sending notifications directly to you in a DM or group chat
- üìç **Location Management** - Registered channels may choose to receive notifications only from specific areas, instead
                              of getting alerts from the whole damn country whenever they decide to launch a missile.
- üì± **Mobile/Overlay Notifications** - Notifications from the bot are clear and readable even on Discord's mobile and
                                       overlay notifications.
- ü§ù **User Friendly** - Start receiving alerts with one simple command, and set up locations with simple
- ‚öô **Developer Friendly** - Self-hosting supported and encouraged, and the code is documented and easily expandable.

# Setup
Invite the bot to a server, /register a channel, and you're ready to go!

Alternatively, you can /register a Direct Message / Group DM channel to receive alerts directly!

Please do note that the bot instance listed under the [links section](#links) is hosted on a private machine, and may be
a bit slow. It is recommended to [host your own instance](#self-hosting), if possible.

# Self-hosting
## Requirements
### Knowledge Prerequisites
While we built this bot with self-hosting and ease of set-up in mind, some prior knowledge is still recommended to know
what you're doing.

Some recommended prior knowledge:
- Prior experience with Python as a whole, as well as installing packages with the `pip` package manager.
- Some knowledge on Discord bots and how to create one. (see tutorial [below](#other-requirements))
- Prior experience with MySQL (recommended), or with a different SQL-based RDBMS, and knowledge of how to set one up.

### Required PyPI packages (run each with `pip install`)
**Note:** On Windows you will have to use `python -m pip` instead of `pip` at the beginning of pip install commands

**Note:** as of 2023-10-23, discord.py seems to not install properly for Python 3.11 and above.
The fix we've found is to first install the beta version of package `aiohttp` separately (`aiohttp==3.9.0b0`).

Please use the requirements files (`pip install -r`):

Python 3.10 and below:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.11 and above:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements-3_11.txt
```

### Other requirements
- A discord bot app ([tutorial](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot))
- MySQL Server (Download link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (also available on most package repositories)

## Local data:
### .env file
Save the following to a file named ".env", and replace the angled brackets with the matching data. Do note that it has to be on the same directory as `main.py`.

```env
TOKEN = <Discord bot token>
AUTHOR_ID = <Your Discord user ID>

DB_USERNAME = <MySQL database username>
DB_PASSWORD = <MySQL database password>
```

### botinfo file
In [botinfo.json](botinfo.json), change the "maintainer" value (default is "GaMeNu (@gamenu)") to your username, and maybe add contact information. This is in order to allow others to contact you about issues with your specific instance, and will be publicly available through /info.

**Make sure not to write personal or private information in the botinfo file!** Everything within that file will be publicly available to everyone using the /info command.
